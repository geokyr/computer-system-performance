## Analytical Assignments

There were 3 analytical assignments in total. Each assignment had a set of problems to be solved. The problems involved the use of analytical models, queuing networks, simulation techniques, empirical techniques and performance analysis. The [Java Modelling Tools (JMT)](https://jmt.sourceforge.net/) tool was used, and more specifically its [JMVA](https://jmt.sourceforge.net/JMVA.html) and [JWAT](https://jmt.sourceforge.net/JWAT.html) tools. The assignments covered the following topics.

## Analytical 01

- Mean Value Analysis - MVA
- Flow Equivalent Server - FES
- Load Dependent Server - LDS

## Analytical 02

- Performance Prediction
- Scheduling Algorithms - FIFO, LWTF, LRUF
- Regenerative Method

## Analytical 03

- Workload Characterization
- Workload Analysis
- What-If Analysis
