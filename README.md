## Analytical Assignments

There were 3 analytical assignments in total. Each assignment had a set of problems to be solved. 

The [Java Modelling Tools (JMT)](https://jmt.sourceforge.net/) tool was used, and more specifically its [JMVA](https://jmt.sourceforge.net/JMVA.html) and [JWAT](https://jmt.sourceforge.net/JWAT.html) tools. The assignments covered the following topics.

- Analytical Models
- Queuing Networks
- Simulation Techniques
- Empirical Techniques
- Performance Analysis
- Mean Value Analysis (MVA)
- Flow Equivalent Server (FES)
- Load Independent Server (LIS)
- Load Dependent Server (LDS)
- Performance Prediction
- Scheduling Algorithms - FIFO, LWTF, LRUF
- Workload Characterization
- Workload Analysis
- What-If Analysis
